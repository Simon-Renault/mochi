						<p>
							Living in the bustling city of London (UK), I have
							always been curious and attentive to the world
							around me. Drawing has become a way for me to escape
							daily life, let my mind wander and create world of
							itâ€™s own.
						</p>
						<p>
							Currently passionate about the relationship between
							mankind and nature, I often draw intricate
							cityscapes where luxurious vegetation meets
							architecture. Inspired from my many trips across
							Europe or Japan, I like to mix different
							architecture styles, cultures and languages.
